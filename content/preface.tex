In this preface,
I wish to provide some context for the journey that led to the development of this graphics engine.
As a lifelong video game enthusiast with a penchant for programming,
I've always had an interest in developing graphics software.
Be it just for the enjoyment of getting visual results from writing code,
or working towards a larger goal like publishing a video game.

As for why I chose Common Lisp as a programming language,
I could spell out many reasonable and pragmatic arguments,
but the truth is that ever since I learned how to use it,
I've been looking for a project to use it in.

The development of this project was not an easy task.
However, it was driven by personal curiosity,
and a desire to understand and craft the low-level aspects of a graphics engine.
Apart from being an academic project,
it has been a project of passion.

In sharing this work,
I hope to provide insight into the process of developing a graphics engine from scratch.
May it inspire other enthusiasts to embark on their journey of exploring the fascinating intersection of programming, graphics, and gaming.

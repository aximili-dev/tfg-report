\label{SEC:ARCH}

To keep with the spirit of building a minimalist graphics engine,
the architecture has been designed as a set of interfaces,
bundled together in a library.
The primary entry point into the engine is the \texttt{with-graphics} macro.
By itself however,
it will only create a window and open it.
Everything else in the engine is optional to use,
and the remaining sections in this chapter will describe each of these modules in detail.

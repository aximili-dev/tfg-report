The purpose of this project is not to compete with industry-standard graphics or game engines.
Rather it seeks to provide developers with a simple and accessible tool set,
that empowers them to dive straight into rendering.
The ubiquity of OpenGL ensures that the resulting software is likely to be cross-platform\cite{khronos}.
The flexibility and the powerful macro system of Common Lisp allow for an intuitive library interface\cite{practical_cl}.

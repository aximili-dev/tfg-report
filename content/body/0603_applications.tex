This project shows that graphics programming can be quite accessible to any capable developer.
The simplicity of this particular engine means in order to get started with any type of graphics programming,
a developer only needs a few lines of code.
This aligns with the main goal that was set out,
to allow any developer to create prototypes for simple graphics and get immediate results.

However with some extra work,
this engine could also be applied to heavier and more complex workloads.
If one wanted to develop a video game,
it provides almost all the necessary tools to get started with that.
Any missing features can be added to the engine at any time or developed as separate components.

Another application that comes to mind is visualizations for physics simulations.
Since the engine is build with mesh-manipulation in mind,
certain physics simulation types like erosion or soft bodies could easily be implemented with it.

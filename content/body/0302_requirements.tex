When it comes to software requirements,
there isn't much to say.
Any modern operating system capable of running an ANSI compliant Common Lisp implementation,
should be capable of setting up the development environment and making modifications to it.
Besides that,
in order to actually run the final programs,
necessary graphics drivers should be installed with support for the desired OpenGL version.

On the hardware side,
so long as the rendering hardware has drivers with support for OpenGL,
it will at least run the programs built with this engine.
The minimum performance requirements for the hardware will depend on the complexity of the rendered scenes.

\index{Testing}

Due to most of the code using OpenGL functions,
writing tests was challenging at times.
Because of this most of the testing was what I will call exploratory testing,
where I set up small and contained scenes with the purpose of testing a singular module.
However there were some parts where unit tests turned out to be not only possible to write,
but also very helpful.

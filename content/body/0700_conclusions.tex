\label{SEC:CONCLUSIONS}

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Many gamedev resources recommend NOT implementing an engine from scratch,
%  I can understand that now,
%  this project was quite hard
%\item It was also very interesting,
%  learned a lot about rendering and graphics in general
%  learned how to use OpenGL
%  learned many interesting algorithms like Perlin Noise, Marching cubes
%\end{itemize}

In conclusion,
this project has achieved its initial objective of creating a useful and flexible graphics engine.
By combining the strengths of OpenGL with the flexibility of Common Lisp,
it enables developers to render a wide array of 3D scenes.
The project code can be found at \url{https://github.com/aximili-dev/learnopengl}.

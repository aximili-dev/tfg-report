% We have a working engine

After completing the project's lifecycle,
the result is a functional graphics engine.
The interface it provides is simple to use,
and easy to work with to create graphics visualizations.
The project code can be found at \url{https://github.com/aximili-dev/learnopengl}.

The feature set aligns with the goals that were decided at the start of the project.
The engine is capable of loading meshes from files,
and creating procedural meshes.
The Phong reflection model was implemented and meshes can have diffuse and specular textures mapped to them.
Perlin noise was implemented and used to create procedural and natural-looking meshes.
Finally,
the project stayed inside the specified scope,
without growing beyond control.

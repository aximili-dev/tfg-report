\label{SEC:SUMMARY}

The main findings of this project are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Developing a functional graphics engine using Common Lisp and OpenGL is feasible and advantageous due to the combination of a feature-rich graphics \ac{api} and a flexible programming language.
\item The use of Perlin noise and procedural meshes enables the creation of organic and natural-looking meshes.
\item The process of developing graphics software without prior experience or the help of an existing engine proved challenging,
  highlighting the complexity of graphics programming.
\end{itemize}

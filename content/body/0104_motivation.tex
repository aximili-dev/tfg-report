% Mixed interests
% - Computer graphics
% - Programming in Lisp

The inspiration for this project stems from an interest in computer graphics,
and an appreciation for Common Lisp's programming style.
Whenever I would try to start on a graphics project,
I would be faced with two possibilities.
Either learn how to use a complex engine,
or start completely from scratch developing against a low level \ac{api}.
Upon the completion of this project,
I hope to have a tool that will allow me to pursue those interests.

Originally the Engine was going to be written in Rust,
because of its many stated benefits like a strong type system,
borrow and move semantics,
and its ability to produce highly performant code.
However after some months working on the project,
Rust's type system proved too rigid for the flexibility and freedom I was looking for.
At that point,
I decided to rewrite what I had up to that point in Common Lisp,
and continued working from there.

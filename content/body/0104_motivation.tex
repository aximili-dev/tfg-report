% Mixed interests
% - Computer graphics
% - Programming in Lisp

The inspiration for this project stems from an interest in computer graphics,
and an appreciation for Common Lisp's programming style.
Whenever I would try to start on a graphics project,
I would be faced with two possibilities.
Either learn how to use a complex engine,
or start completely from scratch developing against a low level \ac{api}.
Upon the completion of this project,
I hope to have a tool that will allow me to persue those interests.

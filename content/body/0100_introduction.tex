Computer graphics and 3D rendering have rapidly evolved in the last few decades.
This evolution has led to sophisticated tools and engines.
While these resources are powerful,
they can often be complex and challenging for developers,
especially those who wish to rapidly prototype or focus primarily on rendering.
As an example,
the third edition of \textit{Game Engine Architecture} is over one thousand pages long\cite{gameengine_arch},
covering a wide range of distinct topics.
This thesis presents a project focused on creating a streamlined and intuitive \dfn{graphics_engine}\index{Graphics Engine},
based on OpenGL and written in Common Lisp,
prioritizing ease-of-use for the developer.

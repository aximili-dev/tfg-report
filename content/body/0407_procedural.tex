\subsection{Base mesh}

When generating procedural meshes,
it is very useful to have a starting point.
I found the easiest starting point was a simple plane.
Multiple planes can be combined to form cubes,
and the vertices of a cube can be normalized to form a sphere.

OpenGL supports a type of indexed mesh called a triangle strip.
In this mesh,
the \ac{vbo} as always holds all the unique vertices.
The \ac{ebo} however,
instead of indexing individual triangles,
will make use of the fact that in a plane most vertices are shared by multiple triangles.

\subsection{Mesh manipulation}

Once a base mesh has been generated,
transformations can be applied to it to get procedural or even organic shapes.
If for example we sample a 2D plane of fractal noise based on perlin noise,
and use the random values to modify the height of each vertex,
we can easily create natural looking terrain.
See figure \ref{FIG:TERRAIN}
